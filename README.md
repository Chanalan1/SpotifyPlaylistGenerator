# SpotifyPlaylistGenerator
<br/>
<br/>
## Project Description
### Using the Spotipy python library for the Spotify Web API, this app allows a user to create a playlist of up to 20 random songs.
<br/>
### The playlist is created from a search query that takes the users genre input and year input, concatenates it into a "top {year} {genre} hits" search query, which then finds a playlist and inside that playlist, 20 songs are randomly chosen and put into 
### either a new or existing playlist after clearing the playlist of any previous songs.
